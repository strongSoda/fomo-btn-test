      "I fell in love with this place first time I visited after seeing my friend sign up with these guys. I've toured a couple of their locations and decided to sign up for the Ontario one. Their salespeople are some of the friendliest that I've ever met! Everyone else in the building is also super nice as well. Will be getting to know as many of them as I can so I can start networking my business.",
