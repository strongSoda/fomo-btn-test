    text: "Leased a large amount of space here for a period of 2 years. Was the perfect solution for my rapidly growing business. Have since outgrown the space and moved into my own built-out building, but the flexibility of Cubework was essential in helping my business stay lean and achieve the growth that we saw.  Alen was/is a great building manager, and accommodating especially with the move-out process as it was fraught with delays out of our control. Always happy to recommend Cubework to fellow entrepreneurs who need that flexible space but can't justify a 3-year commitment that comes with a traditional lease.",
