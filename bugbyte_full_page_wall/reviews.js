By the time I had worked with her for 6 months, I had gleaned so much that it will take years for me to incorporate everything she taught me, and many years more to master. Those 12 lessons would change my perspective on singing. But what she taught me on day one would change me forever- she taught me that my own misconceptions were my biggest obstacle; that I was aiming far too low in my aspirations. I went to her to find out if I was ‚Äúwalking‚Äù properly, and she handed me a starship! Francesca didn‚Äôt shatter my glass ceiling, she *vaporized* it! Perhaps even more importantly, she helped me overcome the greatest trigger of my gender dysphoria- the hatred of my own voice! I cannot adequately convey what she means to me in 5 stars; Francesca gave me the universe!",

Her initial questionnaire led me to surprising insights about my presenting limitations and goals, which her in-person assessment deepened. During our session she covered anatomy, pinpointed quasi-medical issues I hadn‚Äôt thought were related, gave me stretches, massage, reading, and more, as homework. Our session felt timeless, rich, colorful, and exciting.

I started with piano lessons to get my feet wet with understanding music and have fallen in love with the instrument. Mainly because Francesca and her teachers focus on getting you playing and really enjoying music for what it is! there is technical aspects which we get into but there is this overwhelming momentum on simplifying what‚Äôs important and exciting. Which makes me want to practice and learn even more! Within days I was able to actually feel and play piano. It‚Äôs been about 2 months now and I‚Äôve progressed way beyond what I thought I could in this short time. Before bugbyte i tried learning via youtube and its just too scattered. Its a breath of fresh air to have someone that cares about you, that creates structure and the gets you excited to learn!",

She always welcomes me with an open heart and love. The studios are a nice cheerful, safe space to be vulnerable while singing. My teacher is my biggest cheerleader, that's always available for a hug or advise. I'm lucky to call her my friend now. Francesca is my voice teacher and life coach. She makes me work hard and always WANT to learn more. I really couldn't recommend her more highly. She's who you need to see if you are looking to expand your artistry. I was so glad she took my call and welcomed me into her studio. It's evident that she loves what are she does. While every pro singer in town ends up at BugByte, I also see Francesca and her assistants working with beginners. So there's room for everyone there, unsurprisingly.",

Ive always dreamed of composing and singing my own original songs, but I was intimidated at first - I didn't have a background in music and felt intimidated with how much their was to learn (and in so many different areas!).  I cannot say enough good things about Francesca and the team at BugByte Studios.  They are kind, intelligent, thoughtful, focused and incredibly passionate folks, and my experience with Francesca and her dedicated team has been truly magical, a once in a life time opportunity and I recommend that any one who has an interest in learning music, take a lesson from Francesca or her team, and you will see for yourself why BugByte is the best studio around.  The environment is safe and welcoming and I really feel the personal connection in my lessons. Francesca designed a curriculum specifically for my goals and my needs, and that makes every lesson so much fun, and she also finds creative ways to challenge me outside the classroom. Ensuring that the educational experience is enlightening and interesting , all the while being productive for my own development as an artist/singer, is just one of the many things that puts Francesca very much in a league of her own.  I am blown away, every lesson, by not only Francesca's vast knowledge and passion, but effortless dexterity in navigating the complexities of singing and music, and expressing it in a way that has not only allowed me to learn it so quickly, but allowed me to so genuinely feel immersed in the subject and all it‚Äôs beauty - I have never before met an educator who has been able to do what Francesca does, she is truly a master. I am eternally grateful for her and the opportunity to work together. It‚Äôs always been my dream to learn music and I couldn‚Äôt have imagined learning anything would be this much fun!",

I mean I wanted to but I was told quite frequently how bad my voice was and more than once (many more times) was told not to sing and just play an instrument. Kinda killed the fun.  I practiced to get better, even was the main vocalist in The Big Decisions for a bit, but I didn't really know how to practice si I didn't make a lot of progress.  So about 2 or 3 years ago I decided to take lessons to get better,  shake the negative words that stuck in my head, and make singing fun. A little way in to taking lessons elsewhere, I was introduced to Francesca Valle by a great friend and started lessons with her.  After maybe 2 years (less i think) of lessons with her, I feel a lot stronger on my voice and more confident. I've learned how to practice better and embraced my range a lot more along with a bunch of other good stuff.  If you happen to need some help with vocals, highly recommend getting in touch with Francesca. She's a pretty awesome teacher (and generally awesome person).",
