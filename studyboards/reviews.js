    text: "Study Boards is magic! I'm glad to have opportunity using such an effective tool. Due to Study Boards my English level improves faster, because I have a chance to see and repeat unknown words on the board with their explanation and correct pronunciation which we used during the lesson whenever I want. I highly recommend Study Boards as I have never seen a platform for learning which structure is so suitable for students.",
